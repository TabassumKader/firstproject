#### Managing Director Goals (8 total)
- ✅ **Goal 1**: Monitor Operational Dashboard - Fully implemented with interactive metrics
- ✅ **Goal 2**: Approve Budget for Network - Fully implemented with approval workflow
- 🔄 **Goal 3-8**: Placeholder implementations with basic structure

#### Domestic Customer Goals (8 total)
- ✅ **Goal 1**: Apply for New Gas Connection - Fully implemented with form validation
- ✅ **Goal 2**: Pay Monthly Gas Bill - Fully implemented with payment processing
- 🔄 **Goal 3-8**: Placeholder implementations with basic structure
